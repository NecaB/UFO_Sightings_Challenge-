# UFO_Sightings_Challenge

Overview

This challenge required creating a dynamic web page to display JavaScript objects in an array or lists about a UFO dataset through a HTML page. This initiative was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings; through filtering column headers, facilitating updates to the table on the web page and adding rows for data input of new sightings.  This was done by creating a table to filter for the date, city, state, country, shape and commenting about the UFO sightings. Additionally, users could also filter for multiple criteria at the same time. These objectives were executed by using JavaScript, HTML/CSS and then Bootstrap was utilized to the tailor the aesthetics on the website. 

Results 

-	A JavaScript code was written in the HTML document using the date form to ‘listen’ for events and check the date/time column for rows that matched the users’ input. 

-	Multiple selection options were created through input tags by writing a JavaScript code that allows users to set filters from criteria such as date/time, city, state, country and shape in search of UFO sightings.

-	Upon entering the website clients will observe a title and picture, as they proceed further on the page, they will notice data and filters that were installed. This webpage displays the different filter options available. You may select any city filter and click enter; this will populate the HTML page which will display data that matches with the search that has been inputted. The page also allows multiple filters to further provide information to inspect the data based on the search criteria that was entered. 

-	Five matches were returned after using a random pick of the city -“el cajon”, with filter  elements of Enter a Shape -  “circle”. However, a filter element for the city “bonita” and Enter a Shape - “triangle” returned no item. 
-	To achieve a search response/ match certain item must be in check, namely; 
a.	lower case letters for all items.
b.	no spaces at the end of the text.
c.	the input box must be off or press the enter key to initiate the filter.
d.	click the UFO Sightings at the top corner to reset the filter criteria.

Summary:

Drawback
The script is very sensitive to specifics. Based on the data input in reference to cities, dates or shapes, changes such as punctuation or capitalization of words, letters or numbers are not accepted. Thus, any query must mimic how the data was entered as that is the only format that will be understood or read by the program. 

Recommendations
Date Range Filter
A date range filter would encompass a broader search which would require less preexisting knowledge before conducting the search. This would accommodate searching over a time frame rather than each individual dates which may provide null values or returns if no sighting occurred on that specific date. 

Radius Reference Filter
A radius reference filter would help incase sightings didn’t happen at the specific location but instead subjectively nearby. This would assist with the investigation of UFO sightings rather than having the possibility of them undocumented. This would provide a larger frame of the sightings and would include all or most that occurred.
